# Quiz 1: COVID-19 Physical Distancing

A maths quiz inspired by the new relaxed COVID-19 rules in South Australia
and Western Australia which permit a density of 1 person every 2 square
metres yet still want you to maintain a distance of 1.5m from others. For
details, see the references section.


## Introduction

Consider a large room with horizontal and vertical lines marked
on the floor such that the floor is divided into *squares*. At
the center of each square is a person (represented by a dot).


## Questions

1. If the area of each square is 4 square metres, how far is each
   person from their nearest neighbour?

2. If the area of each square is 2 square metres, how far is each
   person from their nearest neighbour? [Hint: In this scenario
   we are already violating the 1.5m distance rule... even for
   infinitely thin people, i.e. dots!]

3. For the arrangement/layout given in the introduction, what is
   the area (in square metres) of each square if you require each
   person to be 1.5m from their nearest neighbour?

4. Bonus question: If you have an arbitrarily large room, you can
   calculate its area [A] in square metres then divide by 2 square
   metres to give the maximum number of people [P] permitted in that
   room. Can you find any 2 dimensional arrangement/layout of the
   maximum number of people [P] such that each person is 1.5m or
   more from their nearest neighbour?

   - In other words, I'm looking for a pattern of arranging the
     people in an arbitrarily large room - so I am not expecting
     the square grid arrangement/layout described in the introduction.
   - I'm wanting you to avoid "tricks" like arranging for people
     to stand in the corners of the room and along the edges/walls
     unless you can demonstrate that the trick works for very large
     rooms.
